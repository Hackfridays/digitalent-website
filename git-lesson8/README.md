# Git
## Basics
The "only things" you need to know:
    - git
        - push
        - pull
        - commit
        - status
        - merge
        - PR (application side)

    - Mantras:
        - Always have clear commit messages
        - Always have short and specific commits
        - Always have an untouched master (production) branch
        - Never push to development
        - Always create branches for changes
        - Always create PRs to merge back into Master
        - Google is your friend.
