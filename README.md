# digitalent-website
The many website versions of Digitalent (coding 101).

This package doesn't only refreshes your memory on how to write HTML, it also goes into the tools **Github** and **Atom**.

## Create team folder
* Step 1: clone project
* Step 2: create team folder `team-{your team name}`
* step 3: create new file called `hello.html`

Now commit _(with summary!)_ and Sync. Both members of the team should now see the hello.html file.

## Your first "Hello, World!"
Open the hello.html file and add following text:
```
Hello World.
```

You'll see a lot of helper hints from Atom, we'll get into those shortly.

**Commit & Sync**. You will have a conflict if you didn't agree who in your team reads the line.

Now open the folder in finder and open the `hello.html` file. That's ... not so sexy. Switch authors and and remove the contents of `hello.html`.

We'll now be adding the first HTML basics. Normally, one would now type `<html>`. You'll see some useful infor popping up if you do. Building a structure this way is useful, but we can go faster thanks to Atom. Clear your file and type `html` followed by hitting `[tab]`.

The basic structure is now built for you. Feel free to enter a tag to the file by writing its name and hitting tab again, like `img` for adding images (inside the `<body>` tags).

### Styling
We'll go ahead and `link` a style file to our project.

### Actions
Let's dive into our first **javascript** action. We'll go inline for now, by appending `script` in the bottom part of the `<body>`.

## Let's hack a template
Since we don't want to spend 2 weeks on a website, we're going to be really webdesigner-lazy and work with a template of your choice:

* [startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/one-page/)
* [onepagelove.com](https://onepagelove.com/templates)
* [readytheme.net](https://readytheme.net/free-one-page-bootstrap-templates/)

There are many others. Google at least one with the terms "free", "one page" and "template".

**Happy Hacking!**
